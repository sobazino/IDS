Intrusion Detection System (IDS): A network security tool that monitors network traffic and devices for malicious activity, suspicious activity, or security policy violations. It can be either network-based or host-based.

NIDS stands for Network Intrusion Detection System. It's a security tool that monitors network traffic for malicious activity, such as attacks, malware, or policy violations, and alerts administrators to potential threats. NIDS are typically passive, meaning they don't actively block attacks, but rather identify them and report them.
